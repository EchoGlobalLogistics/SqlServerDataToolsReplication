SqlServerDataToolsReplication
=============================

SQL Server Data Tools Extensions for Replication Management is an in progress library designed to support SQL Server replication management via the same workflow concepts that are used in SQL Server Data Tools, including:

- Extraction of information from a database
- Compiling user-readable source into a compiled model
- Comparing compiled models and extracted models to determine the SQL necessary to make the target conform to the source

Special thanks to Echo Global Logistics (http://www.echo.com), for which this code library is being created, for permitting this codebase to be contributed to the public at large for utilization and enhancement by others.
